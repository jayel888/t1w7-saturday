# Wildcard Arguments
- Used when you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function
- Non-keyword argument *args
- Keyword arguments eg. greet(fname = "Jess", lname = "Lee") **kwargs

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY Coding Principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file
- Solves the problem of code file being too lengthy and copmlex
- Can be reused across several programs
- Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons Standard Library

# Packages
- Collection of modules
- Organise related modules under one directory
- Initialise a package using __init__.py file

- importing names to shorter name (import module.submodule.subsubmodule as short_name)

## Practical Example
Task:
- Create a package with basic text processing with modules for:
    - Counting words in a string,
    - Counting characters in a string, and
    - Reversing strings.

# Slicing a sequence
- Way to extract parts of data structures, like strings, lists, tuples.
- Syntax: sequence[start:stop:step] (like range)
- Default of start: 0
- Default of stop: End
- Default of step: 1

# Object Oriented Programming
- It is a way to help programmers structure the functionality of the program that would make sense to humans and would allow computerse to run it efficiently.
- Almost all programming languages use this concept
- It uses "objects" to model real-world entitites.

## Key Concepts
- Class
    - A blueprint for creating objects.
- Object
    - An instance of a class
    - It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by a class.
    - Eg. A built house with many features (as function)
    - Eg.
